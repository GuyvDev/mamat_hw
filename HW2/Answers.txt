1.We reused a lot of code between the different programs. We could have combined all the programs into one program. By that, we would have saved unnecessary reuse of code.

2.  When we ran the command 10,000 times and inserted the data into "hist.exe" we got distribution that corresponded to continuous uniform distribution:
0-9     1002
10-19   1055
20-29   992
30-39   967
40-49   1003
50-59   1031
60-69   1000
70-79   994
80-89   1005
90-100  954
