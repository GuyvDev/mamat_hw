1. We reused a lot of code between the different programs.
We could have combined all the programs into one program.
By that, we would have saved unnecessary reuse of code.

2. Grades 0-100 are discrete variables. A discrete variable is a finite number
or a countable set of numbers. In our case, there are 101 possible values, 
from 0 to 100 inclusive. Discrete uniform distribution, by definition, 
is a distribution in which all the values in a finite group have equal 
probability, which in our case 1/100. The command "od -An -N2 -i /dev/random"
returns a random number between 0 and 65535 (equivalent to 0xFFFF),
then we take mod 100. Therefore we will get the last two digits from 
the set 0-65535. Hence 100 is not received. The remainders 0-35 (inclusive)
have a slightly higher chance than the other numbers 
(they repeat 656 times in the set 0-65535 compared to 655 times for the others).

Therefore the distribution is not uniform.

However, we should mention that the distribution is very close to a uniform
distribution. It could be correct by adding a finite number of values to the set
of numbers. When we ran the command 10,000 times and inserted the data into 
"hist.exe" we got:
0-9     1002
10-19   1055
20-29   992
30-39   967
40-49   1003
50-59   1031
60-69   1000
70-79   994
80-89   1005
90-100  954
